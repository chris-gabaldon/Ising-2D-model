Ising Model Monte Carlo Simulations
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Ising model. The notebook explores the correlation function and susceptibility of the system to estimate the critical temperature.

Notebook Description
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

Correlation Function Calculation: Defines and uses functions to compute the correlation function
