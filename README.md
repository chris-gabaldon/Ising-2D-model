# Ising-2D-model
This script studies the 2D Ising model, essential for understanding phase transitions. It uses Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the correlation function and susceptibility, determining the critical temperature  𝑇 𝑐 = 2.268 ± 0.002 T  c ​  =2.268±0.002, consistent with theoretical values
